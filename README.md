Imagenette Image Classifier using EfficientNet-B0

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that classifies images from the Imagenette dataset using a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B0 model. Simply upload an image, and the app will predict its class along with a confidence score chart!
ðŸš€ Features
    Upload images (.jpg, .png, .jpeg) directly from your device.
    View a preview of your uploaded image.
    Predict the image class using a pre-trained EfficientNet-B0 model.
    Visualize the confidence scores for each class with a bar chart.
    Lightweight and optimized for both CPU and GPU devices.
